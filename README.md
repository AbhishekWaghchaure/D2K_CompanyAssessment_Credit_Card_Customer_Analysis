# D2K_CompanyAssessment_Credit_Card_Customer_Analysis

📋 Project Overview

This project was completed as part of a pre-assessment task for D2k Technologies. The goal was to predict customer attrition (churn) using a dataset of customer information and interaction metrics. The solution demonstrates a robust machine learning pipeline for identifying at-risk customers, offering actionable insights for retention strategies.

🛠️ Key Features
	•	Data Preprocessing: Cleaning, feature selection, and encoding categorical variables.
	•	Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Gained insights into customer demographics, behavior, and attrition patterns.
	•	Model Selection and Tuning:
	•	Compared multiple machine learning models using cross-validation.
	•	Performed hyperparameter tuning for the best-performing model.
	•	Model Evaluation: Evaluated the final model using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

 🚀 Technologies Used
	•	Programming Language: Python
	•	Libraries:
	•	pandas, numpy for data handling
	•	matplotlib, seaborn for visualization
	•	scikit-learn for model training and evaluation

 🧪 Results
	•	Best Model: Random Forest Classifier
	•	Accuracy on Test Set: 96.9%
	•	Key Insights:
	•	Customers with higher transaction counts and active engagement are less likely to churn.
	•	Targeted interventions for customers with low activity can significantly reduce attrition.
